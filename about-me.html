          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>
            Hi, hello there! I was born and raised in Syria and moved to the
            Netherlands when I was 16, in 2016. I‚Äôve always been an explorer. I
            love experimenting and creating new things.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before studying CMD, I was actually diving into Mechanical
            Engineering, and i still enjoy designing mechanical parts in
            SolidWorks from time to time. Currently, i‚Äôm studying Communication
            and Multimedia Design, and i‚Äôve fallen in love with frontend
            development (or maybe just with spending hours figuring out why the
            code doesn‚Äôt work).
          </p>
          <p>
            My go-to chill vibe? Reading a book by the Rijn on a sunny day ‚òÄÔ∏èüìö.

              I created detailed 3D models and technical workshop drawings using
              SolidWorks. I also managed warehouse inventory, communicated with
              suppliers, and requested quotations from external companies. This
              experience taught me to combine precision design work with
              practical coordination and communication skills.

              At Medical X, I focused on rapid prototyping and 3D printing for
              medical training devices and side projects. I contributed to the
              development process by building and testing physical prototypes,
              helping the team iterate on designs quickly and efficiently. This
              internship strengthened my understanding of the product
              development cycle and the value of hands-on experimentation.

              During my internship at EOX, I created 3D models and technical
              drawings in SolidWorks, contributing to the development of the
              innovative startup project. I also worked hands-on in the
              workshop, helping build prototypes for tractor components. This
              experience taught me how to bridge the gap between digital design
              and physical manufacturing in a fast-paced, experimental
              environment.
